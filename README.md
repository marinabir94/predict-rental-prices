# Predict Rental Prices
This repo contains the Predict Rental Prices for the city of Barcelona. The rental prices were scrapped from a property website based on properties located in Malaysia. Four different types of algorithms were used to train the models which consist of three machine learning (ML) and one deep learning (DL) algorithm. This project focuses on comparing the performance and results of these four algorithms instead of explaining the theory behind the algorithms as it assumes that readers already familiar with these algorithms. For readers who are in a hurry, feel free to dive straight into section 5. Discussion and Conclusion.

## Dataset
The rental prices were scraped from a property website based on properties located in several states in Malaysia i.e. Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Putrajaya and Johor. The data has been intentionally messed up and contain duplicates and errors in order to demonstrate the data wrangling / munging steps required to clean the data before using it to train the models. There is a very interesting tutorial where I checked how to scrape web data using Python [Web Scraping Project](https://github.com/limchiahooi/web-scraping-rental).
